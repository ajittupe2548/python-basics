# A Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members. Tuples are immutable.

# Create tuple
fruits = ('Apples', 'Oranges', 'Grapes')

# Using a constructor
# fruits2 = tuple(('Apples', 'Oranges', 'Grapes'))

# Single value needs trailing comma
fruits2 = ('Apples',)

# Get value
print(fruits[1])

# Can't change value
# fruits[0] = 'Pears'

# Delete tuple
del fruits2

# Get length
print(len(fruits))
